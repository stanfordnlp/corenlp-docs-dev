# Stanford CoreNLP Client

Stanza allows users to access our Java toolkit, Stanford CoreNLP, via its server interface, by writing native Python code. Stanza does this by first launching a Stanford CoreNLP server in a background process, and then sending annotation requests to this server process. The response from the CoreNLP server will then be parsed and rendered into a [`Document`](data_objects.md#document) Python object. As a result of this server-client communication, users can obtain annotations by writing native Python program at the client side, and do not need to worry about anything at the Java server side.
