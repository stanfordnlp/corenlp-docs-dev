## About


Stanza is a Python natural language analysis package. It contains tools, which can be used in a pipeline, to convert a string containing human language text into lists of sentences and words, to generate base forms of those words, their parts of speech and morphological features, to give a syntactic structure dependency parse, and to recognize named entities. The toolkit is designed to be parallel among more than 60 languages, using the [Universal Dependencies formalism](https://universaldependencies.org).

Stanza is built with highly accurate neural network components that also enable efficient training and evaluation with your own annotated data. The modules are built on top of the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) library. You will get much faster performance if you run this system on a GPU-enabled machine.

In addition, Stanza includes a Python interface to the [CoreNLP Java package](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP) and inherits additonal functionality from there, such as constituency parsing, coreference resolution, and linguistic pattern matching.

To summarize, Stanza features:

* Native Python implementation requiring minimal efforts to set up;
* Full neural network pipeline for robust text analytics, including tokenization, multi-word token (MWT) expansion, lemmatization, part-of-speech (POS) and morphological features tagging, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition;
* Pretrained neural models supporting [66 (human) languages](models.md#human-languages-supported-by-stanza);
* A stable, officially maintained Python interface to CoreNLP.

Below is an overview of Stanza's neural network NLP pipeline:

## Getting Started

We strongly recommend installing Stanza with `pip`, which is as simple as:

```bash
pip install stanza
```

To see Stanza's neural pipeline in action, you can launch the Python interactive interpreter, and try the following commands:

```python
>>> import stanza
>>> stanza.download('en') # download English model
>>> nlp = stanza.Pipeline('en') # initialize English neural pipeline
>>> doc = nlp("Barack Obama was born in Hawaii.") # run annotation over a sentence
```

You should be able to see all the annotations in the example by running the following commands:

```python
>>> print(doc)
>>> print(doc.entities)
```

For more details on how to use the neural network pipeline, please see our [Getting Started Guide](installation_usage.md) and [Tutorials](tutorials.md).

Aside from the neural pipeline, Stanza also provides the official Python wrapper for accessing the Java Stanford CoreNLP package. For more details, please see [Stanford CoreNLP Client](corenlp_client.md).

## Main Contributors

The PyTorch implementation of Stanza's neural pipeline is due to [Peng Qi](http://qipeng.me), [Yuhao Zhang](http://yuhao.im), and [Yuhui Zhang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~yuhuiz/), with help from [Jason Bolton](mailto:jebolton@stanford.edu) and [Tim Dozat](https://web.stanford.edu/~tdozat/).

The CoreNLP client is mostly written by [Arun Chaganty](http://arun.chagantys.org/), and [Jason Bolton](mailto:jebolton@stanford.edu) spearheaded merging the two projects together.

We are also grateful to community contributors for their help in improving Stanza.
